# itertools
Python’s Itertool is a module that provides various functions that work on iterators to produce complex iterators. This module works as a fast, memory-efficient tool that is used either by themselves or in combination to form iterator algebra.

Different types of iterators provided by this module are **Infinite Iterator**s, **Combinatoric iterators** and **Terminating iterators**.

## Infinite Iterators
Iterator in Python is any Python type that can be used with a ‘for in loop’. Python lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all examples of inbuilt iterators. But it is not necessary that an iterator object has to exhaust, sometimes it can be infinite. Such type of iterators are known as Infinite iterators.

## Combinatoric Iterators
The recursive generators that are used to simplify combinatorial constructs such as permutations, combinations, and Cartesian products are called combinatoric iterators.

## Terminating Iterators
Terminating iterators are used to work on the short input sequences and produce the output based on the functionality of the method used.
